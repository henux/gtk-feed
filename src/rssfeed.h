/*
 * RSS Feed Parser:
 *
 * The RSS feed parser works in a background thread.  Each RSS feed is read
 * by it's own thread; thus there will be an equal amount of parser threads
 * as there are feeds to read.
 *
 * Each parser gets a feed URI to locate the RSS XML file from and a
 * sub-menu item to put the feed links into.  The parser renames the menu
 * item once it knows the proper title of the feed and builds a submenu
 * under it, where each item in this submenu corresponds to a single feed
 * article.
 *
 * Once the whole feed is read and processed, the background thread frees
 * all necessary resources and exists cleanly.
