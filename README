gtk-feed README

Copyright (C) 2008 Henri HÃ¤kkinen

gtk-feed is intended to become a lightweight GTK+ 2.0 RSS/Atom feed reader.
It works only as a icon on the window manager's system tray and provides
feeds through a popup menu.

The application is very early on it's development and does not yet actually
provide any feed reading capability at all.

The feed icon image file is taken from http://feedicons.com.
