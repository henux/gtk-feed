gtk-feed README

Copyright (C) 2008 Henri HÃ¤kkinen

gtk-feed is a lightweight and minimal GTK feed reader.  It works only as an
icon on the window manager's system tray and provides feeds through a popup
menu.  The project is very early on it's development and much needs to be
done.  The current version supports only RSS 0.91 feeds.

Once started, the program displays an icon on the window manager's system
tray.  You can access the feeds menu by left-clicking on this icon, and the
application menu is accessed by right-clicking.  To subscribe to a new
feed, select "Subscribe" from this menu and enter the URL of the feed.  For
example to subscribe to the GNU Project web feed, use this URL:

    http://www.gnu.org/rss/whatsnew.rss

Web sites syndicate their feeds by using the <link> HTML tag in the <head>
section of the page.  At the moment unfortunately, you will need to find
the web feed URL by yourself by manually inspecting the HTML source code.
This will change into a more user-friendly manner in the next version of
gtk-feed.

Configured feeds are stored in the file $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-feed/feeds.xml
(which usually corresponds to $HOME/.config/gtk-feed/feeds.xml) in an XML
document.  You can take a look at the feeds.xml.dist file distributed with
the gtk-feed source package, which contains web feeds for some of well known
sites :)

Thanks to Jani Mettovaara for giving me the idea for this project.

The feed icon images distributed along with this project are taken from
