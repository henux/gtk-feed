gtk-feed README

gtk-feed is a lightweight and minimal GTK+ 2.0 RSS feed reader.  It works
only as an icon on the window manager's system tray and provides feeds
through a popup menu. The project is very early on it's development and
much needs to be done.  The current version contains only a basic RSS feed
support and not much else.

The program reads the `feeds' file from your `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-feed'
directory (which usually corresponds to `~/.config/gtk-feed').  This file
should contain URLs to XML RSS feed resources, one URL on each line.  Blank
lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.  For example to sign up to
a news feed for the GNU Project, add this to your feeds file:

    http://www.gnu.org/rss/whatsnew.rss

At this moment, there is no easier way to do this other than to manually
scramble through feed URLs :/

Feed articles are accessible from the system tray icon's left click popup
menu.  Clicking on a feed article opens the URL using your web browser.
This is done by using the `xdg-open' utility so you will need to have that
installed on your system.

Thanks for Jani Mettovaara for giving me the idea for this project.
