gtk-feed README

gtk-feed is a lightweight and minimal GTK+ 2.0 RSS feed reader.  It works
only as an icon on the window manager's system tray and provides feeds
through a popup menu.

The application is very early on it's development cycle and is not yet
ready for general use.  A rudimentary support for RSS feeds is implemented
but the application needs much more attention before it can be considered
usable.

Thanks for Jani Mettovaara for giving me the idea for this project.

The feed icon image is taken from http://feedicons.com and it is released
as "public domain".
