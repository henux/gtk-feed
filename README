gtk-feed 0.1 README

Copyright (C) 2008 Henri HÃ¤kkinen

gtk-feed is a lightweight and minimal GTK+ 2.0 RSS feed reader.  It works
only as an icon on the window manager's system tray and provides feeds
through a popup menu.

The project is very early on it's development and much needs to be done.
The current version contains only a basic RSS feed support and not much
else.

The program reads the `feeds' file from your `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-feed'
directory (which usually corresponds to `~/.config/gtk-feed').  This file
should contain URLs to XML RSS feed resources, one URL at each line.  Blank
lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.  For example to sign up for
the news feed from the GNU Project, add this to your feeds file:

    http://www.gnu.org/rss/whatsnew.rss

At this moment, there is no easier way to sign up for news feeds than to
manually scramble through feed URLs :/

Articles for the signed up feeds are available from the left click popup
menu on the system tray icon.  Clicking on a feed article opens the URL
using your web browser.  At the moment, opening URLs is done by using
`xdg-open' utility so you will need to have that installed on your system.

Thanks for Jani Mettovaara for giving me the idea for this project.
